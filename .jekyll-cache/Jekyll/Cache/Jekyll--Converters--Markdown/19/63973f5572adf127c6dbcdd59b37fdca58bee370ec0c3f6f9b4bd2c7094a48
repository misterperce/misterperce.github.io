<h4 id="span">Span</h4>
<p>Set of space achievable by scaling a given set of vectors.</p>

<h4 id="linearly-dependent">Linearly Dependent</h4>
<p>Describes a vector that is redundant in a set of vectors, i.e. does not expand the span of the set of vectors. In contrast, “linearly independent” describes a vector that is additive to the span created by a set of vectors.</p>
