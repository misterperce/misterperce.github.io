I"”<p>Iâ€™m currently in a role in which I have to navigate and explore a lot of new SQL tables that Iâ€™m not familiar with, so I found myself typing â€œselect * from â€¦ limit 100â€ over and over again. I finally decided to automate that phrase such that if I typed â€œsssâ€ it would automatically type â€œselect * from  limit 100â€. I couldnâ€™t be happier with the results. This is how I did it:</p>
