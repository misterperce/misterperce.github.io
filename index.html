  <h1>Hello!</h1>
  <p class="lead">I'm Nancy and I love playing with data. I'd love to share some of my enthusiasm with you!</p>
  <p>I graduated in 2015 with a Bachelor's in Economics from Yale and will be matriculating this fall to MIT Sloan for my Master's in Business Administration. Since college, I have been working at Amazon doing data stuff on various supply chain teams.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I enjoy painting, printmaking, and playing video games. I used to powerlift, too!</p>
  <p>You can find my resume here.</p>
